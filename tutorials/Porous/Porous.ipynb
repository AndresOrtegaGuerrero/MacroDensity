    "# Ionisation potential of a porous material\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we use `MacroDensity` with `VASP` to align the energy levels of a porous material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure involves one DFT calculaion, yielding different important values\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\epsilon_{vbm}$ - the valence band maximum\n",
    "* $V_{vac}$ - the vacuum potential\n",
    "\n",
    "The ionisation potential ($IP$) is then obtained from:\n",
    "\n",
    "$IP = V_{vac} - \\epsilon_{vbm}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference to a bulk calculation is that here the material itself has a vacuum within. That means that we can sample the vacuum level from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure was first outlined in a seminal JACS paper, [read it here](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja4110073).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our system \n",

    "* Optimise the structre\n",
    "* Calculate the electronic structure at your chosen level of theory **Remember in your INCAR:**\n",

    "* Sample the potential from the pore centre\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB** This whole procedure is probably better run in a notebook than by script, the reason being that you can read the file once, then do the manipulations later. The reading is the intensive and time consuming step. "
